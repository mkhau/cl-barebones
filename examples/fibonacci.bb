# Bare Bones example program: compute the Nth value in the Fibonacci sequence
#   F(n) = 0 if n = 0
#   F(n) = 1 if n = 1
#   F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) if n > 1

# start with argument in variable N
# upon completion, result will be in variable F

# G and H used as temporaries

# NOTE: computing the factorial of arguments greater than 42 will take
# a long time.  Fib(43) took approximately 59 seconds to compute on an
# Opteron 246.
